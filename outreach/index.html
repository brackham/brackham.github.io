I am interested in furthering the impact of my research through teaching, mentoring, and public outreach efforts.
Most of the efforts that I have been involved in are listed in my 
<a href="http://brackham.github.io/cv/">CV</a>. Some recent highlights are detailed below.

  <span itemprop="address"><span itemprop="locality">Project POEM aims to foster interest in STEM careers 
    among visually impaired middle and high school students. As part of the kick-off week for Project POEM
    at the UA SkyCenter atop Mt. Lemmon, I recently developed and led an activity that encouraged 12 Project POEM 
    participants to explore the properties of transiting exoplanets using sonified transit light curves.</span>
