Even before the start of my academic career, I have had a keen interest in science education, 
from (primary, secondary and high) school to unversity-level, including public outreach. This 
has been the main driver in a wide range of projects and activities related to teaching, mentoring 
and outreach that I had led during the past years, which I describe below.

  <h3 itemprop="title">Project POEM</h3>
  <p align="justify">
  <span itemprop="address"><span itemprop="locality">Project POEM aims to foster interest in STEM careers 
    among visually impaired middle and high schools students. As part of the kick-off week for Project POEM
    at the UA SkyCenter atop Mt. Lemmon, I recently developed and led an activity that encouraged 12 Project POEM 
    participants to explore the properties of transiting exoplanets using sonified transit light curves.</span>
