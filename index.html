  <h2>Hi, I'm Ben. I study exoplanets and their stars.</h2>

<p align="justify">
 I'm a <a href="https://www.hsfoundation.org/programs/science/51-pegasi-b-fellowship/">51 Pegasi b Fellow</a>
 at the <a href="http://www.mit.edu">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>.
 My research focuses on understanding and correcting for the effects of stellar activity on observations of transiting exoplanets.
 I'm involved in efforts to find new transiting exoplanets and characterize their atmospheres through transmission spectroscopy.
 In the long run, I'd like to know if there's life elsewhere in the universe.</p>
