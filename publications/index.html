       In this work, we used Magellan/IMACS in order to study the atmosphere of the 
       exoplanet GJ1214b, which is the most studied sub-Neptune to date. Past studies have shown that the atmosphere 
       has clouds, which mutes all the spectral signatures of the atmosphere, leaving us with a flat transmission 
       spectrum in many wavelenghts. In the optical, however, the transmission spectrum that we observed not only shows 
       a decreasing slope, but also an overall offset with respect to precise infrarred observations. No exoplanet atmosphere 
       model alone can explain all the data, but adding bright heterogeneities in the stellar photosphere to those atmospheric models 
       beautifully do. This shows that heterogeneities in the stellar photosphere can generate signals in the transmission spectra of 
       exoplanets, which in turn will be very important for future searches of optical atmospheric signatures of planets around M-stars such as 
       GJ1214. We must not forget that we observe planets orbiting <i>stars</i>, which have their own complex photospheres.</font>
